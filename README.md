## Hotel Room Reservation
Hello! This website is one that would be used to book a room at a hotel. One of the main challanges I had was linking the HTML links together to create a more user friendly flow. In the future, I would like to expand upon this idea to not only add more fields but also to revamp the UI some more and to create a more sound testing framework
